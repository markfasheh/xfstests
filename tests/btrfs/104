# FS QA Test No. btrfs/104
#
# Test btrfs quota group consistency operations during snapshot
# delete. Btrfs has had long standing issues with drop snapshot
# failing to properly account for quota groups. This test crafts
# several snapshot trees with shared and exclusive elements. One of
# the trees is removed and then quota group consistency is checked.
#
# This issue is fixed by the following linux kernel patches:
#
#    Btrfs: use btrfs_get_fs_root in resolve_indirect_ref
#    Btrfs: keep dropped roots in cache until transaciton commit
#    btrfs: qgroup: account shared subtree during snapshot delete
